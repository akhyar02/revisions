# Data types

## Primitives

- Primitives are the simplest forms of data in JavaScript.
- They are like atoms, representing basic values.
- Examples of primitive data types: undefined, null, number, string, boolean.
- Primitives do not have properties or methods attached to them.
- Primitives are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed directly.

## Objects

- Objects are composed of primitive values and are more complex than primitives.
- They are like molecules, made up of primitives.
- Objects can have properties and methods attached to them.
- Anything in JavaScript that is not a primitive is an object.
- Objects are sometimes referred to as references, and the object type is known
  as the reference type.
- Objects can be modified by adding, updating, or deleting properties.

## Number

- Numbers are fundamental in computing and are used extensively in various
  fields, including arithmetic calculations, data science, 3D modeling, and
  artificial intelligence.
- In programming, numbers are typically categorized into two groups: integers
  and floats (floating-point numbers).

### Integers

- An integer is a whole number without a decimal point.
- Examples of integers include 0, 1, 100, -30, -50, -100.
- Integers are sometimes referred to as fixed-point numbers.

### Floats (Floating-Point Numbers)

- A float, or floating-point number, is a number with a decimal point.
- Examples of floats include 0.1, 3.878, -4589.4, etc.

### JavaScript's Number Type

- Unlike some programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript does not
  distinguish between integers and floats.
- In JavaScript, there is only one type for numbers, which is simply called
  'number.'
- JavaScript represents all numbers using the 'number' data type, regardless of
  whether they are integers or floats.

### Number Literals

- Number literals are exact representations of numeric values in code.
- In JavaScript, you can use number literals to represent numbers directly in
  your code.

### Examples of Number Operations in JavaScript

- JavaScript allows you to perform various operations with numbers, such as
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The result of these operations depends on the types of numbers involved.

## String

### Strings in JavaScript

- A string is a sequence of textual characters.
- Strings in JavaScript can be defined using single quotes (''), double quotes
  (""), or backticks (``) for template literals.
- Each character in a string has an index, starting from 0.
- The length of a string is the total number of characters it contains.

### Accessing Characters and Length

- To access a character in a string, use square brackets with the index inside,
  e.g., `str[0]` for the first character.
- To find the length of a string, use the `length` property, e.g., `str.length`.

### Autoboxing in JavaScript

- In JavaScript, primitive types, including strings, do not have properties or
  methods attached to them.
- Autoboxing is the process where JavaScript automatically wraps a primitive
  value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class when you try to access
  a property or method on it.
- Wrapper classes for primitives in JavaScript include `String` for strings,
  `Number` for numbers, `Boolean` for booleans, `BigInt` for big integers, and
  `Symbol` for symbols.
- Autoboxing allows you to use properties and methods on primitives as if they
  were objects.
- Autoboxing is implementation-dependent, and the actual mechanism varies among
  JavaScript engines.

#### Example of Autoboxing

- When you access a property on a string primitive, like `str.length`,
  JavaScript autoboxes the primitive into a `String` object temporarily to
  access the property.
- Behind the scenes, it creates a wrapper object, accesses the property, and
  then may delete the temporary object.

Understanding autoboxing is essential in JavaScript as it enables you to work
with primitive values as if they had properties and methods, but it's important
to remember that the actual implementation details may vary across different
JavaScript engines.

## Boolean

- Booleans are values that represent either true or false.
- They are essential in conditional programming to make decisions based on
  evaluation outcomes.
- The term "Boolean" is named after George Boole, a British mathematician known
  as the "father of symbolic logic" and for his contributions to Boolean algebra
  and logic.
- In JavaScript, Booleans are represented using the literal values true and
  false.
- You can create Boolean variables in JavaScript, like var proceed = true; and
  var stopNow = false;. Booleans play a crucial role in controlling the flow of
  a JavaScript program through conditional statements and expressions.

## Object - Array

- An array is an ordered collection of data.
- It's like a sequence of values or a list of items.
- Elements of an array are formally called items or elements.
- Each element has an index in the array.
- The total number of elements is the array's length.

### Array Elements

- Array elements can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, Booleans,
  or even arrays.
- Elements in an array do not have to be of the same data type.

### Creating Arrays

- Arrays can be created using square brackets ([]), where elements are separated
  by commas.
- This is called an array literal.
- Arrays can also be created using the `Array()` constructor.

### Accessing Elements

- Accessing an element in an array is done using square brackets and the
  element's index.
- Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0.
- Accessing an out-of-range index returns undefined.
- The length property is used to get the total number of elements in an array.

### Sorting Arrays

- Arrays can be sorted using the `sort()` method.
- By default, `sort()` sorts elements alphabetically (as strings).
- Sorting is performed in-place (modifies the original array).
- Sorting numbers correctly requires passing a sorting function as an argument
  to `sort()`.

### Sorting Numbers

- To sort numbers correctly using `sort()`, provide a sorting function as an
  argument.
- The sorting function subtracts one number from another (a - b) for ascending
  order.
- This ensures correct numerical sorting.

## Functions

- Functions are used as arguments for sorting and perform specific operations.
- How functions work and their importance in sorting is explored in more detail
  in the chapter on JavaScript Arrays â€” Sorting.

Certainly! Here are some key points to remember about functions in JavaScript
based on the provided information:

### Definition

- A function in JavaScript defines a piece of code that is executed when the
  function is called.
- Functions are used to group together code that can be executed later by
  invoking the function.

### Syntax (named function)

- The `function` keyword is used to create a named function.
- The syntax for creating a named function is as follows:
  ```javascript
  function functionName(parameterList) {
    // Function body with statements
  }
  ```

### Invocation

- To call (or invoke) a function, you simply write its name followed by a pair
  of parentheses.
- Invoking a function executes the code defined inside the function.

### Parameter and argument

- Functions can accept additional data called arguments.
- These arguments are defined within the parentheses when calling the function.
- The names used to refer to these arguments inside the function are called
  parameters.
- Parameters are defined within the parentheses when defining the function.

### Return

- The `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function.
- The value to be returned is specified immediately after the `return` keyword
  within the function's body.
- Returning a value allows you to use the result of the function in various
  ways, such as assigning it to a variable or passing it as an argument to
  another function.

## Objects

### Defintion

- An object in JavaScript is a composite data type that consists of properties
  and methods.
- Properties define the characteristics or attributes of an object, while
  methods define its behavior or actions.

### Real world analogy

- Think of objects in JavaScript like real-world objects. For example, a toaster
  oven has properties (model number, warranty period, etc.) and methods (turning
  it on/off, setting a timer).

### Syntax

- Objects in JavaScript are typically created using object literals, enclosed
  within curly braces `{}`.
- Object properties and values are defined as key-value pairs, separated by
  colons (`:`) and separated by commas (`,`).
- Example:
  ```javascript
  var obj = { x: 10, y: 20 };
  ```

### Plain object

- A "plain object" is a specific type of object in JavaScript, known for its
  simplicity.
- It is used when you want to store multiple pieces of information under a
  single name.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  var url = {
    protocol: "https",
    domain: "www.codeguage.com",
    path: "/",
  };
  ```

### Accessing property

- You can access object properties using either dot notation (`object.property`)
  or bracket notation (`object['property']`).
- Example:
  ```javascript
  url.protocol; // 'https'
  url["protocol"]; // 'https'
  ```

### Adding property

- You can add new properties to an existing object using either dot notation or
  bracket notation, along with the assignment operator `=`.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  url.queryString = null;
  url["hash"] = null;
  ```

### Methods

- Methods are special properties of an object that have function values.
- You can define methods on objects just like properties, but with function
  values.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  var url = {
    protocol: "https",
    domain: "www.codeguage.com",
    path: "/",
    getURL: function () {
      return url.protocol + "://" + url.domain + url.path;
    },
  };
  ```

### Invoking methods

- To call object methods, use parentheses `()` after the method name.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  url.getURL(); // 'https://www.codeguage.com/'
  ```

### OOP

- JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language, and objects are
  fundamental to its design.
- Objects allow you to model and encapsulate data and behavior in a structured
  way.

## Typeof operator

### Defintion

- The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is used to determine the data type of a
  given expression and returns it as a string value.

### Primitive types

- For primitive data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans, undefined),
  `typeof` returns a string containing the name of the type.
- Example:
  - `typeof 10; // 'number'`
  - `typeof "Hello"; // 'string'`
  - `typeof true; // 'boolean'`
  - `typeof undefined; // 'undefined'`

### Null Behaviour

- When used with the `null` value, `typeof` returns 'object'. This is a
  historical bug in JavaScript and is not intuitive.
- Example: `typeof null; // 'object'`

### Arrays

- When used with arrays, `typeof` returns 'object', not 'array'.
- Example: `typeof [1, 2, 3]; // 'object'`
- Arrays are objects in JavaScript, and `typeof` treats them as such.

### Objects

- For pure object data types, such as empty objects or objects with properties,
  `typeof` returns 'object'.
- Example:
  - `typeof {}; // 'object'`
  - `typeof {x: 10}; // 'object'`

### Functions

- When used with functions, `typeof` returns 'function'. Functions are treated
  as a special type of object in JavaScript because they are callable objects.
- Example: `typeof function() {}; // 'function'`

### Exceptions

- Functions are an exception to the general rule that objects are labeled as
  'object' by `typeof`.
- Functions are distinguished from other objects due to their ability to be
  called, and `typeof` reflects this by returning 'function' for them.

In summary, `typeof` can be used to determine the data type of expressions in
JavaScript, but it may produce unexpected results for certain values like `null`
and functions. Understanding these behaviors is important for effective
JavaScript programming.

## Object - deeper dive

### Syntax

- Using the "object constructor" syntax:
  ```javascript
  let user = new Object();
  ```
- Using the "object literal" syntax (more commonly used):
  ```javascript
  let user = {};
  ```

### Object literal

The object literal syntax `{}` is a concise way to create objects in JavaScript.
It's widely used and preferred over the "object constructor" syntax.

### Property and key

Objects consist of properties, and each property is identified by a key (a
string). You can think of an object as a cabinet with labeled files, where the
keys are the labels, and the values are the contents of the files.

### Adding property

- New properties can be added to an object at any time using either notation.
- Example: `user.isAdmin = true;`

### Removing property

- Properties can be removed using the `delete` operator.
- Example: `delete user.age;`

### Multiword property

- Property names with spaces or special characters must be enclosed in quotes
  within square brackets.
- Example: `"likes birds": true`

### Square bracket notation

- Square brackets allow you to use any string as a property name, making it
  suitable for dynamic or computed property names.
- Example: `user["likes birds"] = true;`

### Dynamic property access

- You can use variables to access properties dynamically with square bracket
  notation.
- Example: `user[key] = true;`

### Dot notation limits

- Dot notation requires property names to be valid variable identifiers (no
  spaces, special characters, or starting with digits).
- Dot notation cannot be used with dynamically generated property names.
- Example: `user.key` will look for a property named "key" instead of using the
  value of the `key` variable.

### Computed property

- Computed properties in JavaScript objects allow you to use square brackets to
  dynamically set property names.
- This is especially useful when you want the property name to be determined by
  a variable or a more complex expression.
- For example, you can create an object with a property name determined by a
  user's input, like `bag[fruit] = 5;`.

### Property-value shorthand

- Property value shorthand is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to create
  object properties with the same name as existing variables without explicitly
  specifying the property name.
- Instead of `name: name`, you can simply write `name`.
- This shorthand makes object creation shorter and more concise.

### Property name limitations

- There are no limitations on property names in JavaScript objects, unlike
  variable names, which cannot use reserved words.
- You can use any string or symbol as a property name, and other types will be
  automatically converted to strings.
- For example, you can have object properties with names like `for`, `let`, or
  `return`.
- Numbers used as property names are automatically converted to strings, so `0`
  and `"0"` refer to the same property.
- However, there's a special property named `__proto__` that cannot be set to a
  non-object value.

### in operator

- The "in" operator in JavaScript is used to check whether a specific property
  exists within an object.
- It returns `true` if the property exists in the object, and `false` if it
  doesn't.
- You can use the "in" operator with a quoted string for the property name or
  with a variable containing the property name to be tested.

Example:

```javascript
let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
console.log("age" in user); // true, user.age exists
console.log("blabla" in user); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
```

- The "in" operator is particularly useful when a property exists in an object
  but stores the value `undefined`.

Example:

```javascript
let obj = { test: undefined };
console.log(obj.test); // undefined, but property exists
console.log("test" in obj); // true, the property does exist
```

### for...in loop

- The "for..in" loop is used to iterate over all the keys (property names) of an
  object.
- It is different from the regular "for" loop and is specifically designed for
  working with objects.
- The loop syntax is `for (key in object)` where `key` is a variable that will
  represent each property name during each iteration.

Example:

```javascript
let user = { name: "John", age: 30, isAdmin: true };

for (let key in user) {
  // key represents the property name
  console.log(key); // name, age, isAdmin
  // user[key] represents the value associated with the property
  console.log(user[key]); // John, 30, true
}
```

- You can use any variable name instead of `key` to represent the property name,
  such as `prop` or any other valid variable name.

### Order of properties

- Objects in JavaScript are ordered, but the order is not always intuitive.

- The order of properties in an object depends on whether they are considered
  "integer properties" or non-integer properties.

- Integer properties are properties with keys that can be converted to and from
  integers without a change. For example, "49" is an integer property because it
  remains the same when converted to an integer and back.

- When looping over an object's properties with a `for...in` loop, integer
  properties are sorted in ascending order, while non-integer properties are
  listed in the order they were created.

- To control the order of properties in an object, you can use non-integer
  property keys. Adding a "+" sign before property keys, like "+49" instead of
  "49," makes them non-integer, and they will be listed in the creation order
  when looping over the object.

- In the example provided, by using non-integer property keys for phone codes,
  you can ensure that they appear in the desired order when looping over the
  object.

- Here are some examples of integer and non-integer properties:

  - Integer properties: "49" (can be converted to 49 and back), "-123," etc.
  - Non-integer properties: "abc," "name," "surname," etc.

- When you add new properties to an object, they will be listed in the order
  they were added, regardless of whether they are integer or non-integer
  properties.

- Understanding the order of properties in an object is important when working
  with JavaScript, especially in scenarios where the order of property iteration
  matters.

## Prototypes

### Problem with Methods in Constructors

- **Illustrative Example**: The `Point` function creating a new `setTo` method
  for each instance.
- **Issues Highlighted**:
  - Redundancy: Each `Point` instance has a unique `setTo` method, leading to
    unnecessary duplication.
  - Global Scope Pollution: Previous solutions polluted the global scope.
- **Solution**: Avoid defining instance methods in the constructor's body; use
  prototypes instead.

### Understanding Prototypes

- **JavaScript as a Prototype-based OOP Language**: Unlike class-based languages
  (e.g., C++, Java), JavaScript utilizes prototype-based inheritance.
- **Prototype Definition**: The prototype of an object `o` is the object from
  which `o` inherits properties.
- **Inheritance Mechanism**:
  - Properties defined on a prototype object `p` are accessible on an object `o`
    that inherits from `p`.
  - Example: If `a` is the prototype of `b`, properties of `a` are accessible in
    `b`.
- **Inheritance Mechanism**: Objects in JavaScript know their prototypes through
  the [[Prototype]] attribute.
- **Defined in ECMAScript Spec**: Section 10.1 specifies every object has a
  [[Prototype]] attribute, holding a reference to its prototype.
- **Role of [[Prototype]]**: It determines from which object the properties are
  inherited.

### Illustrative Examples

- **Object `b` with Prototype `a`**:
  - `var a = { x: 10, y: 20 };`
  - `var b = { p: 100, q: 200 };`
  - Internally, `b` has a [[Prototype]] attribute pointing to `a`.
- **Array Example**:
  - `var arr = [10, -5, 60];`
  - Internally, `arr` has a [[Prototype]] attribute pointing to
    `Array.prototype`.
- **Object Example**:
  - `var obj = { x: 0, y: 0 };`
  - Internally, `obj` has a [[Prototype]] attribute pointing to
    `Object.prototype`.

### Special Case: Null Prototype

- **Objects with Null Prototype**: An object can have its prototype set to
  `null`, indicating no inheritance.
- **Example**: `Object.prototype` is the only predefined object in JavaScript
  with a null prototype.

### Implementation Note

- **[[Prototype]] as a Spec Feature**: The [[Prototype]] notation is conceptual,
  used for explanation. Actual JavaScript engines may implement it differently
  but conform to the behavior defined in the spec.

### The Object.create() Method

- **Introduction**: `Object.create()` was introduced in ECMAScript 5 to create
  new objects with a specified prototype.
- **Syntax**: `Object.create(prototype[, propsObj])`.
- **Usage**:
  - Creates a new object with the given prototype.
  - The second argument (`propsObj`) is optional and specifies initial
    properties using property descriptors.

### Building Prototype Relationships

- **Example with Objects `a` and `b`**:
  - `var a = { x: 10, y: 20 };`
  - To set `a` as the prototype of `b`:
    - Create `b` using `Object.create(a)`.
    - Add properties to `b` after creation.

### Using Object.create() with null

- **Creating Objects with No Prototype**: `Object.create(null)` creates an
  object with a null prototype.
- **Result**: Such objects do not inherit any properties.
- **Example**:
  - `var o = Object.create(null);`
  - `o.x = 10; o.y = 20;`
  - `console.log(o); // Outputs {x: 10, y: 20}`

### Concept of Prototype Chains

- **Definition**: A prototype chain is a list of prototypes, where each
  prototype is the prototype of the previous one, ending with `null`.
- **Analogy**: Similar to genetic inheritance, where traits are passed down
  through generations.

### Example of Prototype Chain

- **Objects `a`, `b`, `c`**:
  - `var a = { x: 10, y: 20 };`
  - `var b = Object.create(a);`
  - `var c = Object.create(b);`
- **Prototype Chain for `c`**:
  - `b â†’ a â†’ Object.prototype â†’ null`
- **Significance**: Prototype chains are crucial for property resolution in
  JavaScript.

### Property Retrieval Mechanism

- **Process**: When accessing a property, JavaScript looks for it on the object
  first, then on its prototype, and so on up the prototype chain.
- **Stopping Condition**: Stops when the property is found or `null` prototype
  is reached.
- **Property Shadowing**: Properties on an object can overshadow those on its
  prototype.

#### Examples

- Objects `o1`, `o2`, `o3` with inheritance `o3` â†’ `o2` â†’ `o1`.
- Accessing properties on `o3` will first check `o3`, then `o2`, then `o1`.

### Property Assignment Mechanism

- **Surprising Cases**: Understanding JavaScript's property assignment behavior
  is crucial to avoid unexpected bugs.
- **Rules**:
  - If a property is non-writable or a setter-less accessor on the object or its
    prototype, assignment is ignored or throws an error in strict mode.
  - If writable, or a setter exists, it behaves as expected.

#### Demonstrative Examples

- **Object `o` with Non-writable Property**:
  - Defining a non-writable property on `o` will prevent modification, even in
    derived objects.
- **Inherited Properties**:
  - If a property is inherited and non-writable, assignment on derived objects
    is ignored or errors in strict mode.
  - If it has a setter, the setter is invoked.

### Summary of Property Assignment Cases

- **Table Overview**:
  - Own or Inherited | Data or Accessor | Writable? | Has Setter? | Result
  - Own | Data | Yes | â€” | Set property to value.
  - Own | Data | No | â€” | Ignore or error.
  - Own | Accessor | â€” | Yes | Invoke setter.
  - Own | Accessor | â€” | No | Ignore or error.
  - Inherited | Data | Yes | â€” | Create and set own property.
  - Inherited | Data | No | â€” | Ignore or error.
  - Inherited | Accessor | â€” | Yes | Invoke inherited setter.
  - Inherited | Accessor | â€” | No | Ignore or error.
  - Nonexistent | â€” | â€” | â€” | Create and set own data property.

### Distinction Between Own and Inherited Properties

- **Own Properties**: Defined directly on the object.
- **Inherited Properties**: Defined on any object in the prototype chain, but
  not on the object itself.

### Utilities for Distinguishing Properties

- **hasOwnProperty() Method**: Used to check if a property is an object's own
  property.
  - Syntax: `obj.hasOwnProperty(propName)`.
  - Returns `true` if `propName` is an own property of `obj`, otherwise `false`.

#### Example with hasOwnProperty()

- **Initial Setup**:
  - `var a = { x: 0, y: 0 };`
  - Checking `a.hasOwnProperty('x')` and `a.hasOwnProperty('y')` both return
    `true`.
  - `a.hasOwnProperty('z')` returns `false` as `z` is not an own property of
    `a`.
- **Introducing Prototype**:
  - `var proto = { z: 0 };`
  - `var a = Object.create(proto); a.x = 0; a.y = 0;`
  - `a.hasOwnProperty('z')` returns `false`, but `proto.hasOwnProperty('z')`
    returns `true`.

#### Test Case

- **Given Code**:
  - `var o = {};`
  - `Object.defineProperty(o, 'x', { value: 0 });`
- **Question**: What does `o.hasOwnProperty('x')` return?
- **Answer**: `true`, since `x` is defined as an own property of `o`.

### Prototypes and the in Operator

- **Function of in Operator**: Checks if a property is an own or inherited
  property of an object.
- **Mechanism**: It traverses the entire prototype chain to find the property.

#### Example with in Operator

- **Setup**:
  - `var proto = { y: 0 };`
  - `var o = Object.create(proto); o.x = 0;`
- **Usage**:
  - `'x' in o` returns `true` (own property).
  - `'y' in o` returns `true` (inherited property).
  - `'hasOwnProperty' in o` returns `true` (inherited from `Object.prototype`).
  - `'nonExistent' in o` returns `false` (property doesn't exist).

#### Conclusion

- **Combining hasOwnProperty() and in**: These tools help identify if a property
  is own, inherited, or non-existent on an object. This distinction is crucial
  for understanding property access and modification behaviors in JavaScript
  object-oriented programming.

### Understanding the Prototype Property

- **Recap of Constructor Function**: When `new F()` is called, an instance of
  `F` is created with its prototype set to `F.prototype`.
- **Common Misunderstanding**: `F.prototype` is not the prototype of the
  function `F` itself, but the prototype for instances created by `F`.
- **Key Role of F.prototype**: It is an object from which all instances of `F`
  inherit properties and methods.

#### Example: Point Constructor with setTo Method

- **Point Constructor**:
  - `function Point(x = 0, y = 0) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }`
- **Adding setTo Method on Prototype**:
  - `Point.prototype.setTo = function(x, y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }`
- **Benefits**:
  - Memory Efficiency: `setTo` method is defined once on `Point.prototype`, not
    in every instance.
  - No Global Scope Pollution: All related functionality encapsulated within
    `Point`.
  - Better Readability and Maintainability.

#### Example: Item Class with Accessor Property

- **Item Constructor**:
  - `function Item(sellingPrice, actualPrice) { ... }`
  - Defines `sellingPrice`, `actualPrice`, and an accessor property `discount`.
- **Accessor Property `discount`**:
  - Calculates discount percentage based on `sellingPrice` and `actualPrice`.
  - Avoids redundancy and simplifies interface.
- **Using Item Instance**:
  - `var item = new Item(25, 50);`
  - Access and set `discount` property to dynamically calculate selling price.

### Prototype Model Strengths

- **Delegation of Property Assignment**:
  - Assignment to an inherited accessor property (e.g., `item.discount = 30`)
    invokes the setter on the prototype, not creating an own property.
- **Prototype Model Power**: Direct inheritance from objects, leading to simple
  but effective design.

### Understanding Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is a mechanism where one object can inherit
properties and methods from another object, enabling a form of class-subclass
relationships as seen in classical object-oriented programming.

### Emulating Class-Subclass Inheritance

- **Constructor Functions as Classes**: In JavaScript, constructor functions can
  act like classes.
- **Inheriting Methods and Properties**: A subclass can inherit methods and
  properties from a superclass.

#### Example: Shape and Rect Classes

- **Shape Class**:
  - Methods: `move()`, `delete()`.
  - Defined using `function Shape(x, y, fill) { ... }`.
  - Methods added to `Shape.prototype`.
- **Rect Class**: Inherits from `Shape`.
  - Additional property: `width`, `height`.
  - Constructor calls `Shape.call(this, x, y, fill)` to initialize inherited
    properties.
  - Methods added to `Rect.prototype`.

### Establishing Inheritance

- **Initial Approach**: Setting `Rect.prototype = new Shape()`.
  - Inefficient as it creates redundant properties on `Rect.prototype`.
- **Preferred Approach**: Using `Object.create(Shape.prototype)`.
  - Creates an empty object with `Shape.prototype` as its prototype.
  - Efficient and clean, avoiding redundant properties.

#### Testing the Inheritance

- **Creating an Instance of Rect**:
  - `var r1 = new Rect(20, 50, 0, 0);`
- **Accessing Methods**:
  - `r1.draw()` â€“ Specific to `Rect`.
  - `r1.move(-1, 5)`, `r1.delete()` â€“ Inherited from `Shape`.

### Key Takeaways

- **JavaScript's Prototypal Inheritance**: Enables objects to inherit from other
  objects, creating a flexible and dynamic inheritance hierarchy.
- **Object.create Method**: A cornerstone of establishing prototypal
  inheritance, allowing the creation of objects with a specific prototype.

### Retrieving an Object's Prototype

- **Challenge**: Determining an object's prototype when the constructor is
  unknown or `constructor` property is unavailable.
- **Non-Standard Approach**: `__proto__` property.
  - Returns the prototype of the object.
  - Accessor property defined on `Object.prototype`.
  - Example: `[1, 2, 3].__proto__ === Array.prototype` returns `true`.
- **Standard Approach**: `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method.
  - Syntax: `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`.
  - Returns the prototype of `obj`.
  - Recommended for use over `__proto__`.
  - Example: `Object.getPrototypeOf({ x: 0 }) === Object.prototype` returns
    `true`.

### Setting an Object's Prototype

- **Changing an Existing Object's Prototype**:
  - Two methods: Assigning to `__proto__` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()`.
- **Using `__proto__`**:
  - Syntax: `obj.__proto__ = newValue`.
  - Direct assignment to change the prototype.
  - Example: `b.__proto__ = a` sets `a` as the prototype of `b`.
- **Using `Object.setPrototypeOf()`**:
  - Syntax: `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, proto)`.
  - Sets `proto` as the prototype of `obj`.
  - Example: `Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a)` sets `a` as the prototype of `b`.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Both `__proto__` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()` can negatively impact
    performance.
  - They disrupt internal optimizations for property access.
  - Recommended to use `Object.create()` for new objects instead of altering
    prototypes of existing objects.

### Key Points

- Retrieving an object's prototype is crucial for understanding inheritance and
  behavior.
- JavaScript provides both standard (`Object.getPrototypeOf()`) and non-standard
  (`__proto__`) ways to retrieve an object's prototype.
- Setting an object's prototype after its creation (`__proto__`,
  `Object.setPrototypeOf()`) is possible but should be used cautiously due to
  potential performance issues.
